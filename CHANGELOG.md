# Changelog

All notable changes to **Relay** (`rly`) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Workspace versions are kept in lockstep across the npm package (`relay`), the
Tauri GUI frontend (`gui/package.json`), and every `Cargo.toml` in the workspace
(`tui/`, `gui/src-tauri/`, `crates/harness-data/`). The `pnpm changeset-version`
script runs `changeset version` then `scripts/sync-versions.mjs` to keep them
aligned.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — Unreleased

First public OSS release. Everything below was done under the `OSS-01..20` hardening +
launch-prep push; there was no prior tagged release, so this is the initial one.

### Added

- **OSS-05** — CLI / TUI / GUI parity for rewind, plan-approval, and PR-status
  surfaces. All three dashboards now read the same `~/.relay/` state and render
  the same primitives.
- **OSS-06** — Streaming tool-use parity. The CLI surfaces inline tool activity
  during a stream; the TUI renders a richer stacked view of in-flight calls.
- **OSS-07** — Docs + onboarding pass. `rly welcome` scaffolds
  `~/.relay/config.env` from a template; README MCP-tool list corrected.
- **OSS-09** — Test infrastructure. `harness-data` now has unit tests; CI gains
  a dedicated integration tier alongside the fast scripted tier on every PR.
- **OSS-10** — Cross-platform terminal-tab spawn. macOS (`osascript`), Linux
  (`$TERMINAL` probe with fallback chain), and Windows (`wt.exe` → `powershell`
  → `cmd`) paths are all wired; no-supported-terminal fallback posts a system
  channel-feed entry telling the user to run `rly claude` in the repo manually.
- **OSS-20** — Release pipeline: Changesets-driven versioning with a Cargo sync
  script, `.github/workflows/release.yml` that publishes to npm + builds per-OS
  GUI artifacts (macOS `.dmg`, Linux `.AppImage` + `.deb`, Windows `.msi`) + cuts
  a GitHub Release on `v*` tags. `install.sh` gained a preflight that checks for
  `node >= 20`, `pnpm`, `cargo`, and the Linux Tauri system libraries.

### Changed

- **OSS-01** — Rewind hardening. JSON injection resistance, rollback
  integrity, mid-stream abort handling, orphan-ref cleanup, expanded tests.
- **OSS-02** — Tauri IPC hardening. `run_cli` now enforces a strict command
  allowlist; IDs are validated before use; the activity-cap pre-append check
  prevents runaway memory growth in the GUI.
- **OSS-03** — Subprocess env whitelist + MCP non-loopback hard-stop. Child
  processes get a scrubbed env by default (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  AWS creds, anything matching `SECRET_NAME_PATTERN` are stripped). `rly serve`
  refuses to bind a non-loopback interface without a token unless
  `--allow-unauthenticated-remote` is passed.
- **OSS-04** — Surface silent observability failures. Observability sinks
  that fail no longer swallow errors; they surface through the system channel.
- **OSS-08** — Wire-or-delete cleanup. Removed unreachable pod-executor code
  paths and stale orchestrator `crosslinkRepos` dead code that never shipped.
  Dropped the orphaned `@kubernetes/client-node` dependency.

### Security

- **OSS-17** — Security polish. Config files written by `install.sh` are
  `chmod 600` on creation; `~/.relay/config.env` is preserved with the same
  permissions on re-install.
- **OSS-15** — Purged personal references from committed files.

### Fixed

- **OSS-11** — Flaky-test stabilization: orchestrator tests now consistently
  run under scripted mode regardless of the host shell's `HARNESS_LIVE` value.

### Infrastructure

- **OSS-19** — Removed all legacy `agent-harness` references (bin alias,
  `~/.agent-harness` auto-migration, `AGENT_HARNESS_*` env fallbacks, doc
  mentions). `rly` is the sole CLI; `~/.relay/` is the sole data path.
